# AdventOfCode

Repository where I keep my attempts to complete each day of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).  

This is a challenge where each day leading up to Christmas, a new coding challenge is released at midnight EST.

I will be asleep then, but will attempt to complete the challenges when I find time in the next few days!

# AdventOfCode

Repository where I keep my attempts to complete each day of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).  

This is a challenge where each day leading up to Christmas, a new coding challenge is released at midnight EST.

I will certainly be asleep then, but will attempt to complete the challenges when I find time in the next few days!

Some folks that I am following to see their approaches:

- [Theo](https://github.com/t3dotgg/aoc-2022)
- [nexxeln](https://github.com/nexxeln/aoc-2022) 
- [xiel](https://github.com/xiel/advent-of-code)

I have found that doing the exercise is a good learning experinece.  Doing the exercise AND reviewing solutions from people with different (and often better) approaches has been a GREAT learning experience.
